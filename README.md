You can try the demo here: [React To Do List](https://garagulya.github.io/react-to-do-list-demo)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

With this demo it is possible to:
- add a task (click Add or press Enter);
- see the completion date of each active task;
- complete a task by checking up the checkbox;
- un-complete (activate) a task (it goes to the end of the active tasks list above).

Also:
- If a browser window is refreshed, all completed tasks are removed and not displayed anymore.
- A completed task is automatically removed after 1 minute of its completion time.
- All completed tasks are ordered by completion time.
- Local storage is used to save the list of active tasks.
